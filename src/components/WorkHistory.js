          <p>I began at Hansen (formerly Sigma Systems) as a Junior Developer and over my time have worked my way up to the title of Senior.</p>
          <p>During that time the project team I am a part of rewrote the application from NodeJS into .NET and then into the world of containerisation and AWS.</p>
          <p>Along the way I found my love for all things automated testing, taking ownership of the acceptance test that I led the creation of. At the time of writing the application boasts over 11000 automated tests of all shapes and sizes, and I am always looking to improve our coverage and techniques whenever possible.</p>
